      <h3>Define stage</h3>
      <p>This stage requires a problem statement to be properly defined. From the results of the survey, I now have a sense of what potential users expect from my portfolio. One method that designers use to define a problem statement would be to
        create an empathy map. An empathy map would illustrate a user, through a made-up persona. The following are empathy maps for Alan; a potential employer and Samantha: a future colleague.</p>
      <h4><em class="descriptions">Empathy Maps</em></h4>

        </div>

        <p>From these personas, I am able to come up with a problem statement, which is necessary in the ideating stage in a later stage.</p>
        <b>Problem statement: Users to my portfolio website would need a way to <u> get details on my work abilities, skills and experience for the job I applied for</u> because <u>they would not want to hire someone that is not suitable for the
            job.</u></b>

      <h3>Ideate stage</h3>
      <p>It is during this stage that I am able to explore the features that would be added into the website. From the results gathered from the user research survey, we have determined that users want to see my work skills, abilities and experience.
        This is where I
        would be finding potential solutions this. To accomplish this, a flow sketch could be utillised. A flow sketch wireframe would ensure that the solutions that I would come up with is user-focused, defines the website
        features and is quick to create.</p>

      <p>With help from other coursemates who are also working on their own websites, we collaborated and drew several flow sketches. After a dozen of sketches, I settled on the sketch above for the low fidelity flow-sketch.</p>
